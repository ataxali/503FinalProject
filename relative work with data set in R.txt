## R image classifcation with MNIST and CIFAR-10 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KernelKnn/vignettes/image_classification_using_MNIST_CIFAR_data.html

** Notes: 

1. The work above for the dataset is performed in white-black scale(gray 0- 255), but should be applicable

** Question: 

1. should we perform data reduction on R/G/B respectively or jointly ,i.e.
    list[3] *row[1024(32*32pixels per color)] *col[60000(6000units*10 categories) ]
    or the latter 
    row[3*1024] * col[60000]
   ** personally think the latter one is easier and makes more sense, havent search if there paper done in both ways.

## HOG(Histogram of oriented gradients) 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients

** Notes:

1. Seems to be a commom and popular approach for image processing, is wildly use in multiple reasech works

** Question: 

1. Should we use HOG to replace/ in addition to the current existing dimension reduction/ feature selection.

** Notes: using LDA extracted feature and feed into deep neural net, hence Deep LDA.
